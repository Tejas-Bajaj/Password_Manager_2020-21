# **INTRODUCTION:**

**"JUST REMEMBER ONE PASSWORD FOR ALL PASSWORDS"**

Seldom have we forgotten our passwords. It is time for a password storage revolution to begin.

We proudly introduce our new password manager functionality to you. We have used enhance encryption to make sure no one would be able to crack your passwords and its super simple to use and now you can keep a long password without forgetting it.

Real life examples like WhatsApp bring forward the meaning of encryption and data security. Data is the modern day heist material and we must protect it at all costs. Our encryption makes sure none of your personal data gets leaked while keeping you at ease and not making it too tough to access your passwords.

**WORKING DESCRIPTION:**

**Encryption** :

Converts your password to specially coded ASCII numerals(about 97 of them) into 97 base system. Then converts the 97 base system to 10 base system. After that it writes the password fully and starts reading it vertically instead of horizontally. The vertical characters obtained are now stored using another key randomly generated using the program. The key is the one that actually tells the program to read which column first. This key is unique to every password and makes sure that user data cannot be stolen (even after his MySQL password is stolen since the password is encrypted and stored in MySQL).
